{"id":"pops-claw-hub","title":"Phase 2: Email/Calendar Integration (Gmail)","description":"## Goal\nEnable OpenClaw to read/summarize emails and manage calendar on a Gmail account.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Google Cloud project with Gmail API and Calendar API enabled\n- OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)\n- User's Gmail account to integrate\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Google Cloud Setup\n- Create project at console.cloud.google.com\n- Enable Gmail API and Google Calendar API\n- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)\n- Download credentials JSON\n\n### 2. OpenClaw Configuration\n- SSH to EC2: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/clawdbot-key.pem ubuntu@100.72.143.9`\n- Add Gmail plugin config to ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json\n- Set up OAuth token storage\n\n### 3. Gmail Pub/Sub (Real-time notifications)\n- Create Pub/Sub topic in Google Cloud\n- Grant Gmail publish permissions\n- Configure webhook endpoint or polling\n\n### 4. Testing\n- Test email read access\n- Test calendar read/write\n- Verify real-time notifications work\n\n## Key Questions to Ask User\n1. Which Google account for Gmail/Calendar?\n2. What scopes needed? (read-only vs full access)\n3. Should agent be able to send emails or just read?\n\n## References\n- OpenClaw docs: https://openclaw.ai/\n- Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api\n- EC2 access: 100.72.143.9 via Tailscale\n- SSH key: ~/.ssh/clawdbot-key.pem","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-30T09:39:32.024068-08:00","created_by":"andykaufman","updated_at":"2026-01-30T09:40:50.965653-08:00","labels":["phase"]}
