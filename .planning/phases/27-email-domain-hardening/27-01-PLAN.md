<objective>
Execute domain warmup checklist, escalate DMARC from p=none to p=quarantine, and configure health monitoring with readiness gate for Phase 29.

Purpose: Production-grade email domain reputation is the prerequisite gate for subscriber sends in Phase 29. Without enforced DMARC, email deliverability cannot be trusted for audience distribution.
Output: Verified DMARC at p=quarantine, completed WARMUP.md checklist, updated morning briefing thresholds, readiness gate tracking in email-config.json.

**Part A: DNS Verification (WARMUP.md Step 1)**

SSH to EC2 (100.72.143.9) and run all DNS verification checks:

```bash
# SPF
dig TXT send.mail.andykaufman.net +short

# DKIM (3 Resend selectors)
dig CNAME resend._domainkey.mail.andykaufman.net +short
dig CNAME resend2._domainkey.mail.andykaufman.net +short
dig CNAME resend3._domainkey.mail.andykaufman.net +short

# DMARC (current -- expect p=none)
dig TXT _dmarc.mail.andykaufman.net +short

# MX
dig MX send.mail.andykaufman.net +short
```

Also check Resend API domain status:
```bash
source ~/.openclaw/.env && curl -s -X GET 'https://api.resend.com/domains' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Confirm: SPF includes amazonses.com, DKIM CNAMEs resolve to *.dkim.amazonses.com, DMARC exists with p=none, MX points to feedback-smtp.

**Part B: Send Warmup Test Emails (WARMUP.md Steps 2-3)**

From EC2, send test emails to both accounts:

```bash
source ~/.openclaw/.env
# To personal Gmail
curl -s -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "Bob <bob@mail.andykaufman.net>",
    "to": ["theandykaufman@gmail.com"],
    "subject": "WARMUP Test - Inbox Placement Verification",
    "html": "<h2>Domain Warmup Test</h2><p>This is a test email to verify inbox placement for mail.andykaufman.net domain hardening (Phase 27).</p><p>Please check:<br>1. This arrived in INBOX (not spam)<br>2. Click Show Original and verify SPF: PASS, DKIM: PASS, DMARC: PASS<br>3. From name shows as Bob</p>"
  }'

# To AirSpace account
curl -s -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "Bob <bob@mail.andykaufman.net>",
    "to": ["kaufman@airspaceintegration.com"],
    "subject": "WARMUP Test - Inbox Placement Verification",
    "html": "<h2>Domain Warmup Test</h2><p>This is a test email to verify inbox placement for mail.andykaufman.net domain hardening (Phase 27).</p><p>Please check:<br>1. This arrived in INBOX (not spam)<br>2. Click Show Original and verify SPF: PASS, DKIM: PASS</p>"
  }'
```

**Part C: Update Morning Briefing Section 9 Thresholds (EML-03)**

SSH to EC2 and edit the morning briefing cron in `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`. Find the morning-briefing job and update Section 9 (Email Health Check) to use two-tier thresholds:

- WARNING tier (Resend account protection): bounce >=2% (min 10 outbound), complaint >=0.08% (min 20 outbound)
- CRITICAL tier (Phase 29 gate blocker): bounce >=5% (min 10 outbound), complaint >=0.1% (min 20 outbound)

Add readiness gate reporting to Section 9. The briefing should read `email-config.json`, check for `dmarc_escalated_at`, and calculate days since escalation:
- If not set: "Phase 29 Gate: NOT STARTED -- DMARC not yet escalated"
- If set and <7 days: "Phase 29 Gate: PENDING -- {N}/7 days ({remaining} remaining)"
- If set and >=7 days with clean metrics: "Phase 29 Gate: READY -- 7+ days clean at p=quarantine"

Keep minimum volume guards (10 outbound for bounce, 20 for complaint). The existing Section 9 SQL queries against email.db remain -- just update threshold language and add the gate status line.

**Part D: Add Readiness Gate Config to email-config.json**

SSH to EC2 and add these fields to `/home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json`:

```json
"dmarc_policy": "none",
"phase29_gate": {
  "requires_days": 7,
  "bounce_threshold_pct": 5,
  "complaint_threshold_pct": 0.1
}
```

Note: `dmarc_escalated_at` is NOT added yet -- that happens in Task 3 after DNS propagation is confirmed. `dmarc_policy` starts as "none" (current state).

Restart the gateway service after jobs.json changes:
```bash
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. All dig commands return expected values (SPF includes amazonses.com, DKIM CNAMEs resolve, DMARC shows p=none, MX resolves)
2. Both test emails accepted by Resend API (HTTP 200 with id field in response)
3. `cat /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); assert 'phase29_gate' in d; print('OK')"` passes
4. Gateway service is running: `systemctl --user is-active openclaw-gateway.service` returns "active"
  </verify>
  <done>
DNS records verified clean (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX all resolving correctly). Test emails sent to both Gmail and AirSpace accounts. Morning briefing Section 9 updated with two-tier thresholds and readiness gate status. email-config.json has phase29_gate config. Gateway restarted with new briefing payload.
  </done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Verify inbox placement and update DMARC DNS record</name>
  <files>DNS records at andykaufman.net DNS provider (external)</files>
  <action>
**What was built:** DNS verification passed, test emails sent to personal Gmail (theandykaufman@gmail.com) and AirSpace (kaufman@airspaceintegration.com), morning briefing thresholds updated, readiness gate config added.

**Human verification steps:**

**Step 1: Check personal Gmail**
1. Open Gmail, find "WARMUP Test - Inbox Placement Verification" from Bob
2. Confirm it landed in INBOX (not spam)
3. Click the three dots menu > "Show original"
4. Verify: SPF: PASS, DKIM: PASS, DMARC: PASS

**Step 2: Check AirSpace email**
1. Open kaufman@airspaceintegration.com inbox
2. Find the same test email from Bob
3. Confirm inbox delivery (not spam)
4. If Google Workspace: check "Show original" for SPF/DKIM PASS

**Step 3: Update DMARC DNS record**
In your DNS provider for andykaufman.net, update or create:
- **Name:** `_dmarc.mail.andykaufman.net` (or `_dmarc.mail` depending on provider)
- **Type:** TXT
- **Value:** `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@andykaufman.net;`

If `dmarc@andykaufman.net` doesn't exist or is hard to set up, use `theandykaufman@gmail.com` instead as the rua address. Either way, set up a Gmail filter to auto-label DMARC reports.

**Step 4 (if using cross-domain rua at andykaufman.net):**
Also add this DNS record to authorize cross-domain DMARC reporting:
- **Name:** `mail.andykaufman.net._report._dmarc.andykaufman.net` (or `mail.andykaufman.net._report._dmarc` depending on provider)
- **Type:** TXT
- **Value:** `v=DMARC1`

**Step 5: Wait for DNS propagation**
After updating, wait a few minutes (typically fast, can take up to 24 hours). Then type "approved" with the rua address you used so the next task can verify propagation.
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms: (1) both test emails landed in inbox (not spam), (2) SPF/DKIM/DMARC show PASS in "Show original", (3) DMARC DNS record updated to p=quarantine</verify>
  <done>Inbox placement verified for both Gmail and AirSpace accounts. DMARC DNS record updated from p=none to p=quarantine with rua tag. Resume signal: "approved" with rua address used.</done>
</task>

    /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json
    /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/WARMUP.md
  </files>
  <action>
**Part A: Verify DMARC Propagation**

SSH to EC2 and confirm the new DMARC record:
```bash
dig TXT _dmarc.mail.andykaufman.net +short
```
Expected output should contain `p=quarantine` and `pct=100` and `rua=mailto:...`.

If rua uses cross-domain address (e.g., `dmarc@andykaufman.net` for a DMARC record on `mail.andykaufman.net`), also verify:
```bash
dig TXT mail.andykaufman.net._report._dmarc.andykaufman.net +short
```
Expected: `v=DMARC1`

**Part B: Send Post-Escalation Test Email**

Send a test email immediately after confirming propagation:
```bash
source ~/.openclaw/.env
curl -s -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "Bob <bob@mail.andykaufman.net>",
    "to": ["theandykaufman@gmail.com"],
    "subject": "Post-DMARC Escalation Test",
    "html": "<p>Verifying inbox delivery after DMARC escalation to p=quarantine. If you see this in your inbox (not spam), the escalation is successful.</p>"
  }'
```

**Part C: Verify No Bounces in email.db**

Check email.db for any recent bounces or complaints:
```bash
sqlite3 /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email.db \
  "SELECT delivery_status, COUNT(*) FROM email_conversations WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour') GROUP BY delivery_status;"
```

**Part D: Activate Readiness Gate**

Update email-config.json with the escalation timestamp and new policy:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone

with open('/home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

config['dmarc_escalated_at'] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
config['dmarc_policy'] = 'quarantine'

with open('/home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(config, f, indent=2)

print(f'Escalation recorded at: {config[\"dmarc_escalated_at\"]}')
print(f'Policy: {config[\"dmarc_policy\"]}')
print(f'Phase 29 unblocks after 7 days: check morning briefing for gate status')
"
```

**Part E: Mark WARMUP.md Complete**

Read the current WARMUP.md on EC2 and update all 5 steps to show COMPLETE status. The warmup checklist was deployed in Phase 22 with steps for DNS verification, authentication testing, inbox placement, monitoring, and DMARC escalation. Mark each step as done with today's date.

**Part F: Restart Gateway (if jobs.json was modified)**

Only needed if any cron config changed in this task. If email-config.json was the only change, no restart needed (Bob reads it at runtime).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `dig TXT _dmarc.mail.andykaufman.net +short` returns record containing `p=quarantine`
2. Post-escalation test email API call returns HTTP 200 with id
3. `sqlite3 /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_conversations WHERE delivery_status IN ('bounced','complained') AND created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour');"` returns 0
4. `python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('/home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json')); assert d.get('dmarc_escalated_at'); assert d.get('dmarc_policy')=='quarantine'; print('Gate active')"` prints "Gate active"
5. WARMUP.md shows all 5 steps marked COMPLETE
  </verify>
  <done>
DMARC record propagated with p=quarantine. Post-escalation test email sent and accepted. No bounces or complaints in email.db. Readiness gate activated with escalation timestamp in email-config.json. WARMUP.md fully completed. Phase 29 will be unblocked after 7 days of clean metrics.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `dig TXT _dmarc.mail.andykaufman.net +short` — must contain `p=quarantine; pct=100; rua=mailto:`
2. `dig TXT send.mail.andykaufman.net +short` — SPF record resolves with amazonses.com
3. `dig CNAME resend._domainkey.mail.andykaufman.net +short` — DKIM resolves to *.dkim.amazonses.com
4. `cat /home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/email-config.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['dmarc_escalated_at'], d['dmarc_policy'], d['phase29_gate'])"` — shows timestamp, quarantine, gate config
5. Morning briefing next run includes two-tier email health thresholds and Phase 29 gate status
6. No bounced or complained emails in email.db within the execution window
