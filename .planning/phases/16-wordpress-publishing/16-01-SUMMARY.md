# Phase 16 Plan 01: WordPress API Credentials Summary

**WordPress Application Password auth configured in sandbox env with verified REST API access to airspaceintegration.com**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-09T21:43:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-09T21:44:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 human checkpoint + 1 auto)
- **Files modified:** 1 (remote EC2 only)

## Accomplishments
- WordPress Application Password generated and provided by user
- Three WP env vars (WP_SITE_URL, WP_USERNAME, WP_APP_PASSWORD) added to openclaw.json sandbox env via jq
- Gateway service restarted successfully
- WordPress REST API verified: drafts endpoint returns 200 with JSON, categories endpoint returns valid category list

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Generate WordPress Application Password** - Human checkpoint (completed by user, no commit)
2. **Task 2: Add WP credentials to sandbox environment and verify API access** - Remote-only changes (EC2 openclaw.json), included in metadata commit

**Plan metadata:** See final commit (docs: complete wp-credentials plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (EC2) - Added WP_SITE_URL, WP_USERNAME, WP_APP_PASSWORD to agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.env

## Decisions Made
- Used WordPress Application Passwords for REST API authentication (simpler than OAuth, sufficient for server-to-server use)
- Credentials stored exclusively on EC2 in openclaw.json, never in committed files

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

WordPress Application Password was generated by user as part of Task 1 (human checkpoint). No additional setup required.

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| WP_SITE_URL in sandbox env | PASS |
| WP_USERNAME in sandbox env | PASS |
| WP_APP_PASSWORD in sandbox env | PASS |
| Gateway service active | PASS (PID 199863) |
| GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=draft | 200 OK, JSON array returned |
| GET /wp-json/wp/v2/categories | 200 OK, JSON array with categories (e.g., Events) |

## Next Phase Readiness
- WordPress REST API credentials are available in sandbox environment for all agents
- Plan 16-02 (publishing skill + cron) can proceed — API access is confirmed
- Existing categories on the site are available for mapping

## Self-Check: PASSED

- [x] 16-01-SUMMARY.md exists
- [x] WP_SITE_URL in sandbox env (true)
- [x] WP_USERNAME in sandbox env (true)
- [x] WP_APP_PASSWORD in sandbox env (true)
- [x] Gateway service active
