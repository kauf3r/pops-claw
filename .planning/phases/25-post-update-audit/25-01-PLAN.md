<objective>
Verify all 20 cron jobs, 13 skills, and 7 agents survived the OpenClaw v2026.2.17 update by diffing expected manifests against live CLI output, and fix any broken items inline.

Purpose: Confirm the major version jump didn't break existing automations (SEC-04, SEC-05, SEC-06). The airspace-email-monitor cron is known to show "error" status and must be investigated and fixed.

Output: Audit report in SUMMARY.md with pass/fail per category, diffs, and inline fixes documented.

  <name>Task 1: Cron manifest audit with inline fix for airspace-email-monitor</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-post-update-audit/25-01-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
Run the cron manifest audit over SSH. All SSH commands need this prefix pattern:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/clawdbot-key.pem ubuntu@100.72.143.9 \
  'OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://100.72.143.9:18789 /home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin/openclaw ...'
```

**Step 1: Capture actual cron list**

Run `openclaw cron list` and capture full output (name, schedule, agent, status for all entries).

**Step 2: Diff against expected manifest**

Expected 20 crons (hardcoded from research -- verified live 2026-02-18):

| Name | Schedule | Agent |
|------|----------|-------|
| heartbeat-main | `0,15,30,45 * * * *` | main |
| meeting-prep-scan | `*/15 * * * *` | main |
| email-catchup | `15,45 * * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | main |
| heartbeat-landos | `2,17,32,47 * * * *` | landos |
| heartbeat-rangeos | `4,19,34,49 * * * *` | rangeos |
| heartbeat-ops | `6,21,36,51 * * * *` | ops |
| review-check | `0 10,15 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | sage |
| airspace-email-monitor | `0 8-18 * * 1-5` (America/Los_Angeles) | main |
| writing-check | `0 11 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | quill |
| anomaly-check | `0 14,22 * * *` | main |
| publish-check | `0 14 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | ezra |
| stuck-check | `0 17 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | ops |
| evening-recap | `0 19 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | main |
| daily-standup | `0 13 * * *` | ops |
| daily-heartbeat | `0 15 * * *` | main |
| morning-briefing | `0 7 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | main |
| topic-research | `0 10 * * 2,5` (America/Los_Angeles) | rangeos |
| writing-check | `0 11 * * *` (America/Los_Angeles) | quill |
| weekly-review | `0 8 * * 0` (America/Los_Angeles) | main |
| pipeline-report | `0 8 * * 0` (America/Los_Angeles) | ops |
| monthly-expense-summary | `0 15 1 * *` | main |

Compare actual vs expected: flag any missing, extra, renamed, or schedule-changed crons.

**Step 3: Investigate and fix airspace-email-monitor error**

Research shows this cron has status "error". Investigate:
1. Check recent cron runs: try `openclaw cron runs airspace-email-monitor --last 5` or similar CLI command to see error details
2. Check gateway logs: `journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway.service --since "1 hour ago" 2>&1 | grep -i airspace`
3. Identify root cause and fix inline. Common causes: gog auth token refresh failure, missing reference doc, config issue after update.
4. If fixable, apply fix and verify cron status changes to "ok" on next check.

**Step 4: Note monthly-expense-summary "idle" status**

This cron fires on the 1st of the month (`0 15 1 * *`). Status "idle" is expected because it hasn't fired yet this month. Document as normal -- not an error.

Record all findings for the SUMMARY.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `openclaw cron list` shows all 20 crons present (name match)
- No unexpected missing or extra crons
- airspace-email-monitor error investigated (fix applied or root cause documented)
- monthly-expense-summary idle status documented as expected
  </verify>
  <done>All 20 cron jobs confirmed present in openclaw cron list. Airspace-email-monitor error investigated and fixed (or root cause documented with remediation). SEC-04 satisfied.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Skills and agents manifest audit</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/25-post-update-audit/25-01-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
Run skills and agents manifest audits over SSH. Same SSH prefix as Task 1.

**Step 1: Capture actual skills list**

Run `openclaw skills list` and capture output. Filter for openclaw-managed skills (not bundled).

**Step 2: Diff against expected skills manifest**

Expected 13 openclaw-managed "ready" skills (verified live 2026-02-18):
1. ClawdStrike
2. coding-assistant
3. Content Editor
4. Content Strategy Research
5. Govee Smart Home
6. Oura Ring Health Data
7. receipt-scanner
8. Resend Email
9. save-voice-notes
10. secureclaw
11. SEO Content Writer
12. social-promoter
13. wordpress-publisher

For each skill, verify it shows "ready" status. If any show "missing" or other non-ready status, investigate and fix inline.

Do NOT invoke skills directly -- especially resend-email, wordpress-publisher, or social-promoter which have real side effects. Status check only.

**Step 3: Capture actual agents list**

Run `openclaw agents list` and capture output.

**Step 4: Diff against expected agents manifest**

Expected 7 agents:
1. main (Bob) -- heartbeat cron: heartbeat-main-15m (status should be "ok")
2. landos (Scout) -- heartbeat cron: heartbeat-landos-15m (status should be "ok")
3. rangeos (Vector) -- heartbeat cron: heartbeat-rangeos-15m (status should be "ok")
4. ops (Sentinel) -- heartbeat cron: heartbeat-ops-15m (status should be "ok")
5. quill (Quill) -- no heartbeat, verify via writing-check cron status "ok"
6. sage (Sage) -- no heartbeat, verify via review-check cron status "ok"
7. ezra (Ezra) -- no heartbeat, verify via publish-check cron status "ok"

Agent responsiveness is confirmed by their associated cron job status from Task 1. The 4 heartbeat agents (main, landos, rangeos, ops) have 15-min heartbeat crons all showing "ok". The 3 content agents (quill, sage, ezra) have task crons showing "ok". If any agent is missing or its cron is in error, investigate and fix inline.

**Step 5: Compile full audit report**

Combine cron, skills, and agents results into the SUMMARY document:
- Executive summary: X/20 crons OK, X/13 skills ready, X/7 agents responsive
- Cron audit table with status column
- Skills audit table with status column
- Agents audit table with responsiveness evidence
- Fixes applied section (if any)
- Requirements sign-off: SEC-04, SEC-05, SEC-06
  </action>
  <verify>
- `openclaw skills list` shows all 13 openclaw-managed skills as "ready"
- `openclaw agents list` shows all 7 agents
- All agents confirmed responsive via their associated cron status
- SUMMARY document contains complete audit report with pass/fail per category
  </verify>
  <done>All 13 openclaw-managed skills confirmed ready. All 7 agents confirmed present and responsive. Full audit report written to SUMMARY. SEC-05 and SEC-06 satisfied.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. `openclaw cron list` output has 20 entries matching expected names
2. `openclaw skills list` shows 13 openclaw-managed skills all "ready"
3. `openclaw agents list` shows 7 agents
4. airspace-email-monitor error resolved or documented
5. SUMMARY.md exists with complete audit report

- 13/13 openclaw-managed skills show "ready" status
- 7/7 agents confirmed present and responsive
- airspace-email-monitor error investigated and addressed
- SEC-04, SEC-05, SEC-06 requirements signed off in SUMMARY
