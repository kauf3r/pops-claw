## Recent Activity

| Date | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2026-02-08 | Completed 02-01-PLAN | Oura skill deployed, health.db with real data (sleep=74, readiness=74, resting_hr=60), sandbox env configured |
| 2026-02-07 | Completed 01-02-PLAN | Memory active (builtin sqlite-vec+FTS5), security hardened, token rotated, OAuth scopes audited |
| 2026-02-07 | Completed 01-01-PLAN | OpenClaw v2026.2.6-3, security audit clean, ClawdStrike baseline maintained |
| 2026-02-07 | v2 milestone created | 11 phases, 70 requirements from 30-60-90 roadmap |

## Blockers

None

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 4 agents (Andy, Scout, Vector, Sentinel) | Match actual domains | 2026-02-01 |
| SQLite over Convex | Already exists, simpler | 2026-02-01 |
| Domain Slack channels | Clear separation | 2026-02-01 |
| Wyze via Gmail parsing | No official API | 2026-02-07 |
| Haiku for heartbeats | Rate limit management | 2026-02-07 |
| Sentinel = infra + coding | Natural fit | 2026-02-07 |
| New milestone (v2) | Broader scope than original 4-phase plan | 2026-02-07 |
| No safety-scan in v2026.2.6 | Used security audit --deep + skills check instead | 2026-02-07 |
| builtin IS sqlite-hybrid | Config value "sqlite-hybrid" invalid; "builtin" provides same sqlite-vec+FTS5 | 2026-02-07 |
| dmScope=main | "direct" not in schema; "main" is most restrictive valid option | 2026-02-07 |
| Gmail scope reduction deferred | 2 excess scopes; re-auth disruption not worth it now | 2026-02-07 |
| API base: api.ouraring.com | cloud.ouraring.com is auth/docs only; API lives at api.ouraring.com | 2026-02-08 |
| health.db in agent workspace | Sandbox can't access parent dirs; /workspace/health.db inside container | 2026-02-08 |
| Sandbox env injection pattern | API tokens must go in openclaw.json sandbox.docker.env, not just .env | 2026-02-08 |
