## Integration Findings

### Functional Break: Content Pipeline (PIPE-01)

**Root cause:** Two issues stacked:

1. **Wrong DB path:** `db-paths.ts` maps `content` to `/home/ubuntu/clawd/agents/main/content.db` (0 bytes). Real content.db is at `/home/ubuntu/clawd/content.db` (323KB, 11 articles).

2. **Status value mismatch:** `metrics.ts` queries for statuses `researched`, `written`, `reviewed`, `published` but the real `articles` table uses `approved` and `draft`.

**Fix:** Update `db-paths.ts` line 19 to correct path, then reconcile status values in `metrics.ts` with actual schema.

### Orphaned Exports (Non-critical)

- `AGENT_COUNT` in `constants.ts` — defined but unused (inline `AGENTS.length` used instead)
- `chart.tsx` and `table.tsx` — installed in Phase 29, consumed in Phases 31-32

### Verified Flows (4/5 Working)

1. ✓ Dashboard Load and Auto-Refresh — SWR 30s polling, all 5 endpoints
2. ✓ Agent Health Status Card — coordination.db + observability.db → 4/7 alive
3. ✓ Cron Success Status Card — jobs.json → 100% success rate
4. ✓ Activity Feed with Load-More — 3-source merge, 50/page, dedup
5. ✗ Content Pipeline Display — broken at DB path (shows zeros despite 11 real articles)

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item |
|-------|------|
| Phase 29 | `chart.tsx` and `table.tsx` installed but unused (prep for 31-32) |
| Phase 30 | `global-search.tsx` has `return null` stub |
| Phase 30 | `AGENT_COUNT` exported but unused |
